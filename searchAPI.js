"title": "Whiskey Barrel Cuff Links in Gunmetal Finish with Velvet Gift Bag",
"description": "These elegant cuff link makes a great groomsman gift or the perfect gift for the man who has everything.  The cuff links are Gunmetal finish and the wood is hand crafted using the oak from a used Jack Daniels whiskey barrel.  The head on these cuff links is approximately 5/8 of an inch.  Each pair is handcrafted and therefore may be  slightly different in grain and wood tones.  The pictures are a representation of what you will receive.  \n\n\nMy Jack Daniels items are made from white oak barrel staves from authentic Jack Daniels charred oak whiskey barrels used for aging whiskey. The whiskey is aged in these barrels and then the barrels are salvaged and disassembled for the staves.\n\nA Certificate of Authenticity will be included with each Jack Daniels item purchased. \n\nAlso included is a nice black velvet gift pouch.\n\nJACK DANIEL’S is a registered trademark and is not involved in or affiliated with the production or distribution of this product.\n\n\nPlease check out all my Jack Daniels products at:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PensPrintsAndThings?section_id=15976969&ref=shopsection_leftnav_1",

"announcement": "WELCOME TO MY SHOP.  I have had a lot of fun customizing orders for people over the past few  years.   \n\nMy son is a welder and I started making welding caps for him and his co-workers.  My most requested item is the reversible  &quot;CROWN ROYAL&quot; welding cap.  I use the liquor bags themselves, cut them apart and design each cap on an individual basis.  They are all UNIQUE!  I try and keep many colors in stock.  Presently, I have black, green, maple brown, purple, and camoflauge purple. I also design caps with various novelty themes, as requested.  My most requested novelty fabrics use pin up girls, guns, beer panels, and marvel comics.  Remember  these caps are reversible, so have an idea what you would like shown on the flip side. Most  caps are personalized per customer request  giving you a one of a kind purchase.   Feel free to message me with any ideas you may have and let&#39;s see what unique item can be constructed between us!  \n\nFor the women, I construct totes, messenger bags, and shoulder bags..  Both of my daughters are nurses, giving me added incentive in creating items using the nursing themed fabrics.  I have  purchased quite a few different novelty fabrics for this line.\n\nFor the kids, I have backpacks for purchase and love to customize the fabrics for these too.  If you have a certain theme in mind, send me a message and we will fabric search to find material to your liking, .\n\nI have fallen in love with repurposing furniture for purchase within the area I live in.  I wish shipping wasn&#39;t an issue because I would love to list them also, but there is no  plan of this happening in the immediate future.    \n\nCome and browse my shop at any time and ask me about ordering something specifically wanted by you.  We will see what we can come up with.\n \nThank you for stopping by.",

"description": "&gt;&gt; SALE! Buy 3, 4th is FREE! &lt;&lt;\nUse COUPON CODE: BOOOTEE when you buy 3 shirts to get the 4th FREE! \n(Add 4 shirts to your cart and apply code!)\n\nABOUT OUR TEES AND INK:\nWe strive to print on some of the softest shirts around, while keeping our prices low. We believe that even novelty shirts deserve to be comfortable! Our charcoal is a polyblend and contains polyester for an even softer feel.\n\nOur tees are a medium-weight, meaning they aren&#39;t a heavy cotton, nor a thin fabric. We find that a medium-weight is more durable than light cotton, while also allowing skin to breathe for a comfortable fit. All of our shirts are pre-shrunk and feature a tear-away label. We adhere a hangtag to each garment with our cute little ghost mascot (we do not include price tags). Most of our tees are 100% ringspun cotton, several of our heathered shirts are polyblends. Please read below about our sizing and the cut of our tees.\n\nAll of our designs are available for print on Mens/Unisex, Ladies, Maternity, Youth, Toddler, and Infant garments. Please message us if you do not see the cut of shirt you&#39;d like in the drop-down.\n\nOur inks are water-based and non-toxic. Our environmentally-friendly inks last for countless washes with no cracking, peeling, or fading!\n\nTEE SIZING:\nPlease refer to this listing&#39;s photos for our size chart, see below for other sizes. If you are able, we recommend taking a quick measurement of an existing tee before ordering to ensure the garment will fit. I recommend comparing the measurements to tee that has gone through the wash that has a comfortable fit :)\n\nWhen measuring, please lie the t-shirt on a flat surface, and 1&quot; down from the armpit, measure across to achieve the chest size/width. For length, measure from next to the collar to the bottom seam of the shirt.\n▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄\nADULT SIZES:\nRefer to the photo in the listing for specifications.\n*UNISEX/MENS are true to size as per most of our customers and the brand that manufacturers it. Please measure if unsure.\n*LADIES are side-seamed for a more feminine, form-fitting cut, featuring a thinner collar and wider neck than our unisex/mens fit, which is looser fitting. If it is for yourself, we recommend measuring beforehand to get an idea of how it may fit on you. If you are unsure of sizing or prefer a looser fit, we recommend possibly going up a size.\n▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄\nMATERNITY SIZES:\n*Maternity sizes are true to size, with come customers saying they run larger.\nSMALL chest: 18&quot;\nMEDIUM chest: 19&quot;\nLARGE chest: 21&quot;\nXL chest: 23&quot;\n2XL chest: 24&quot;\n▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄\nCHILDREN&#39;S SIZES (see below):\n\nYOUTH FIT TEE:\nS : 22&quot; length x 17&quot; chest (approx. size 6-8)\nM: 23.5&quot; length x 18&quot; chest (approx. size 10-12)\nL: 25&quot; length x 19&quot; chest (approx. size 14-16)\n▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄\nTODDLER FIT TEE\n*Toddler tees are true to size and are unisex. We do not recommend going up a size. For example, 2T is the best fit for a two year on average.\nBODY WIDTH X FULL BODY LENGTH (in inches)\n2T: 13X15.5\n3T: 14X16.5\n4T: 15X17.5\n5/6T: 16X18.5\n\nWASH INSTRUCTIONS:\nThey are preshrunk, however even preshrunk garments can shrink if not washed according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions on the tag. We recommend washing on cold and tumble-drying low for best results.\n\nTEE & INK COLOR:\nIf there is a t-shirt size or color you need that is not listed, please send me a message! We can also print on American Apparel Mens/Unisex and Ladies t-shirts, please message us or send us a Custom Order Request for this option.\n\nPlease refer to the T-shirt Color Chart in the listings photos to see what ink (white or black) will be printed on the tee color you selected. If you’d like an ink color that is not shown, please let me know and we will try to accommodate that :)\n\nCUSTOM DESIGNS:\nWe can print your own custom designs. Please send us a Custom Order Request! Customs are also still eligible for our Buy 3, get the 4th free. A extra fees may be charged to design the shirt. We provide a mockup upon request after purchase.\n\n\nSHIPPING:\nPLEASE CHECK OUR SHIPPING POLICIES FOR OUR CURRENT PROCESSING SPEED! It may vary around those busier holidays :)\n\nAll items ship from the United States and come with USPS tracking information. It is the customer&#39;s responsibility to monitor tracking and to contact USPS for issues with addresses or delays in transit.\n\nUSA: Shipping within the US typically takes about 2-5 business days to arrive once shipped depending on your location. If you order 3 or more items, your shipping is upgraded to Priority Mail and will arrive in 1-3 business days once shipped.\n\nCANADA: Once shipped typically takes 5-14 BUSINESS DAYS OR LESS.\n\nINTERNATIONAL : Once shipped typically takes 5-21 BUSINESS DAYS OR MORE DEPENDING ON YOUR COUNTRY. Please check your country&#39;s custom regulations as delays or additional fees to the customer may be incurred based on customs policies. We are not responsible for fees that are incurred in customs and are unable to predict any fees that you may encounter, please check with your country&#39;s customs regarding these fees before purchasing if there is concern. \nSome countries may not agree to continue with tracking scans for USPS to keep tracking available, so tracking information may end once it leaves the US if your country has such policies.\n▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄\n\n\nRETURNS AND EXCHANGES:\nWe do understand it can be a challenge to find the perfect size online without being able to try it on before purchase, especially with variations in sizing across thousands of brands. If you need a change in size or color, please message me within 7 days of receiving your order and let me know. We will ask you to ship the item back to us and then we will happily ship out the replacement free of charge :)\nIf you&#39;d like a refund, we will ask you to ship the item back to us and we will promptly refund for the cost of the t-shirt upon receipt :)\n\nTHANK YOU for supporting us and small businesses like ours!",

"description": "Groomsmen Gift, Personalized Whiskey Decanter. This engraved whiskey decanter is the perfect men’s gift. Personalized with the name of your choice, this custom whiskey decanter will be displayed with pride for years to come. It’s a great gift for groomsmen, boyfriends, husbands and fathers alike.\n\nThis personalized liquor decanter is topped with a square glass stopper. Unlike many lightweight glass decanters you’ll find, this guy has a heavy, solid base and weighs in at almost 3lbs. It will also hold 28oz (850ml) of his finest malted beverage. \n\nEach decanter comes in a beautiful gift box.\n\nSize: 8.5” x 3.5” x 3.5”\n\n**DURING CHECKOUT**\nPlease leave your personalization request (name and birth year where applicable by design style) and preferred style in the Notes to Seller when you checkout.\n\nProcessing takes 3-5 business days. Shipping takes an additional 2-9 business days.\n\nPlease contact us with any questions.\n\nPlease Note: \n*Whiskey not included (we would if we could!)\n**For orders outside of the USA, it is down to the discretion of the customs agency in your territory whether customs will be charged on the import of this item. It&#39;s unusual, but can happen. Any fees incurred are the responsibility of the purchaser.",

"description": "This listing is for a set of 3 personalized and engraved whiskey stones.  It comes with a small black velvet pouch for storage.  These engraved stones&#39; resulting initials are in a dark black color, per the listing image.\n\nThese sipping stones are dark gray cubes of solid granite that will chill your liquor without diluting it. Unlike ice, sipping stones are odorless and tasteless. Adding sipping stones to your favorite bourbon or scotch will chill the spirit without affecting its taste. Because stone retains its temperature longer than ice, sipping stones provide for a more sustained chill.\n\nWhiskey stones are the perfect gift for the refined connoisseur of spirits.\nThis stone&#39;s edges are slightly rounded as to not scratch the bottom of the glass.\n\nUsually ships in 2-3 business days. Place your order now and in your order notes describe what you want engraved on each stone. Our graphics specialist will have a sample proof ready for you to approve. We do not engrave until we have your approval!\n\nUse:\n-Rinse the stones\n-Put in freezer 4 hours before use\n-Serve 3 stones to chill the drink\n-Let stand for a few minutes and enjoy it\n-Wash the used stones and put back in the freezer\n\nDimensions of each stone:\n0.75 inches wide x 0.75 inches tall x 0.75 inches deep",

"description": "Men, we know the enemy by many names... it is unrelenting and unyielding... it carries no flag, nor does it adhere to sovereign borders or treaties... This enemy marches on, without pausing to sleep or rest - its strength grows in any climate, be it the deserts of the Sahara or the severe whipping winds of the arctic.  Like a deadly street drug - it goes by many names... &quot;stubble&quot;, &quot;peach-fuzz&quot;, &quot;five o&#39;clock shadow&quot; to name a few.  \n\nFor me, this story became all too personal when one ordinary night, when I was kissing my four year old daughter goodnight, she spoke these words to me, &quot;Daddy, your Whiskeys are tickling me!&quot;.  \n\nIn that terrifying moment, I cursed this seditious enemy and it&#39;s guerilla tactics, and vowed to design a recipe for a bar of shaving soap that was so masterful and crisp, a bar literally bubbling with lather and natural clays to give the swiftest of glides - that no man on this planet would ever again have a desire to &quot;let the enemy&quot; grow another day.  \n\nIt needed to be refreshing and rejuvenating, crisp and clean - yet a bar of action.  It needed to set the stage for any razor, no matter the quality or condition - laying down covering fire in the form of rich conditioning lather.  This recipe my friends, is the birth story of a redeemer, aptly named (by my daughter), &quot;Whiskey Milk&quot; - the newest all natural bar from Lost Elixir and the first bar specially formulated for the combat of daily shaving.\n\n------------\n\nThis recipe is formulated with deep skin conditioning oils including avocado oil, sweet-almond oil, and safflower oil and complemented by a carefully designed blend of orange, lemon, cedarwood, and rosemary essential oils.  This bar was built on a foundation of bentonite clay and organic milk - with subdued and mellow clean tones, understated yet beautifully balanced.  All around, this is really well balanced recipe, and a batch that we&#39;re very proud to now offer.\n\nAll our soaps are made in very small batches using the traditional cold process method of soapmaking. No fragrance oils or artificial colorings or additives are included in any of our Lost Elixir soaps. All natural guaranteed. Prepare to be enchanted...",
